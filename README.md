## Project Overview
This project analysis the data for a sales company called Evergreen PLC for a period of January 2023 - September 2023 showing the total sale, profit, customers across board and filtering per country, region, month, quarter. We seek to have a better understanding of the company performance for this period and identify trend in data over this period of time.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the Overall Sales trend?
- What is the Overall Profit trend?
- What is the Total Customer Trend?
- What is the Total Sales/Target Sales relationship?
- Customer and Sales per region.

## Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The Company sales experience an increase and later a drop at the close of the period
2. The month of May generated the highest sale, while January generated the lowest sales
3. Columbia has the highest customers, while Brazil has the least customers
4. Chicago is the region with the highest sales generated.
5. There was increase in customer for each month and september recorded the highest customer. 

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotion during the sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting sales in
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high LTV customer effectively.

## Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from sales and customers column because they would affect the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis.
